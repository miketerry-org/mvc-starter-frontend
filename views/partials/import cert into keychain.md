To import SSL certificates into macOS Keychain Access, follow these steps:

üîê Importing an SSL Certificate into Keychain Access

1. Open Keychain Access

Go to Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access, or search "Keychain Access" in Spotlight (Cmd + Space). 2. Choose the Right Keychain

On the left, select:
System (for system-wide trust) ‚Äî requires admin privileges.
Login (for current user only) ‚Äî no admin privileges needed. 3. Import the Certificate

Go to the File menu > Import Items‚Ä¶
Select your certificate file (.crt, .pem, .cer, or .p12/.pfx).
Click Open. 4. (If prompted) Enter your password

You may be asked for your macOS account password to allow changes.
‚úÖ (Optional) Set the Certificate to Always Trust
If it's not trusted by default:

In Keychain Access, find the certificate you just added.
Double-click it to open its Info window.
Click the Trust dropdown.
Set ‚ÄúWhen using this certificate‚Äù to Always Trust.
Close the window ‚Äî you'll be prompted to authenticate again.
üß™ Tips
For .p12 or .pfx files, the import may also include a private key.
You can verify the certificate is working by checking it in Safari or using curl.
Would you like help verifying that the cert is correctly installed or creating a certificate from scratch?
