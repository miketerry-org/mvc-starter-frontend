<h1>Virtual Life Coach – Welcome to Two Roads Movement with Dylan Terry</h1>

<section class="intro">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Dylan Terry</strong>—a <strong>virtual life coach</strong> based in Salt Lake City. I’m truly glad you’re here. I help individuals gain clarity, purpose, and confidence—no matter where you're starting from or where in the world you are.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Life Coaching and How Can It Help You?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Life coaching</strong> is about building momentum and making meaningful progress toward your goals. Whether you're navigating change, pursuing personal development, or simply feeling stuck, I’m here to support you. All coaching sessions are virtual—via phone or video—so you can connect in a way that’s private, convenient, and tailored to your comfort.

<section class="about-me">
  <h2>Meet Your Online Life Coach – Dylan Terry</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a 27-year-old Arizona native who found a second home—and a deeper purpose—in <strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>, in 2012. My personal journey has included struggles with addiction, disability, and relationships. Through it all, I discovered resilience, self-trust, and the transformative power of support and growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    While therapy plays a vital role in emotional healing, sometimes what you need is forward momentum. As your <strong>online life coach</strong>, I offer a safe space, honest conversations, and practical tools to help you take the next step with clarity and courage.

    Feeling overwhelmed? Stuck? Not sure what’s next? You’re not alone—and you don’t have to figure it out by yourself. We’ll identify priorities and break things down into manageable steps that create real, sustainable change.

  <p>
    Whether you’re navigating a life transition, facing career uncertainty, working through relationship struggles, or feeling unmotivated—I can help you gain clarity and take confident, intentional action toward your goals.

  <h3>Life Coaching vs. Therapy: What’s the Difference?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Coaching is future-focused.</strong> While therapy helps you heal the past, life coaching helps you design your future. As your coach, I’m here to be your guide, thought partner, and accountability ally—to keep you motivated and moving forward with purpose.
