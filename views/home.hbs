<h1>Welcome to Two Roads Movement</h1>

<section class="intro">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m
    <strong>Dylan Terry</strong>—and I’m genuinely glad you’re here. As a
    virtual life coach, my mission is to help you move forward with purpose,
    clarity, and confidence—wherever you are in life, and wherever you are in
    the world.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Life Coaching?</h2>
  <p>
    Life coaching is about creating momentum and making meaningful progress.
    Whether you're working toward a personal goal, navigating change, or feeling
    stuck, I’m here to support you. Our sessions happen virtually—via phone or
    video—so you can connect from the comfort and privacy of your own space.

<section class="about-me">
  <h2>Meet Dylan</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a 27-year-old Arizona native who found a second home—and a new
    purpose—in Salt Lake City back in 2012. My path hasn’t been easy. I’ve faced
    challenges with addiction, physical disability, and tough relationships. But
    through these experiences, I’ve learned resilience, self-trust, and the
    incredible value of support.
  </p>

  <p>
    While therapy plays a crucial role in emotional healing, not everyone needs
    deep clinical work. Sometimes, we just need someone to listen, ask the right
    questions, and help us move forward. That’s what I offer as a life coach:
    honest conversation, practical guidance, and a clear path toward your goals.

  <h2>What I Can Help You With</h2>
  <p>
    Feeling overwhelmed? Stuck in place? Unsure of your next move? You’re not
    alone—and you don’t have to figure it out on your own. Together, we’ll break
    things down, set priorities, and create small, doable steps that lead to
    real change.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don’t need to have it all figured out. Whether you’re facing a life
    transition, career indecision, relationship challenges, or just a general
    lack of motivation, I’m here to help you see things clearly and take action
    with confidence.
  </p>

  <h3>Life Coaching vs. Therapy</h3>
  <p>
    Coaching isn’t therapy—and that’s okay. Therapy focuses on healing the past.
    Coaching is about building your future. My role is to be your guide, thought
    partner, and accountability ally. I’ll help you stay focused, motivated, and
    honest with yourself as you take the steps that matter most.
  </p>

  <h2>Come As You Are</h2>
  <p>
    This is a safe, judgment-free space where you can show up fully and
    honestly. No goal is too big or too small. Together, we’ll design a plan
    that feels right for you—and supports your unique journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also believe life coaching should be accessible. That’s why I keep my
    rates affordable—so cost doesn’t stand in the way of progress.
